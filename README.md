# Design Patterns and Architecture – Cipher Project

This project implements several classical encryption algorithms (Playfair, Winston, Vigenère) using a modular and extensible architecture based on well-established software design patterns (Strategy, Factory Method, Decorator, Singleton, Command). There are two modes: colsole and WinForms.
